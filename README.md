# find-my-district-map
The "Find My District Map" web page helps users locate their NYC council district based on their address. It uses Leaflet.js for the interactive map, jQuery for handling user input and API calls, and Turf.js for geospatial analysis. The page fetches address suggestions, determines the district, and displays the information on the map.
